 A students attendance system using QR code by F Masalha, N Hirzallah
 
 - use Quick Response(QR) code because of fast readability and greater storage capacity compared to UPS barcodes
 - Lecturer genrates QR code using information such as Course, name of lecturer, date and time of lecture, passcode etc. and display on slide
 - students log into app, scan qr code, (and run a facial check) to register attendance
 - can add a location check (I suppose GPS) to ensure no fraudulent registaration (students can send qr code by email, whatsapp etc and process can be replicated outside class)
 
QR-Code Generator by Sutheebanjard and Premchaiswadi
[not sure much of this can be used in our project]

- QR codes have large capacity, small printout size and high speed scan
- also error correction capability (image can be recovered even if large amounts of image is damaged)
- Libqrencode --> C library for encoding data in a Qr code symbol, qrencode (in CLI)

Instead we can use http://goqr.me/api/ to generate QR codes.
