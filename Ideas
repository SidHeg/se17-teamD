1.Fake profile accounts in the social networking websites.
  One of the problems with Social Networking Webistes being poor user authentication mechanisms. 
  Usually, the accounts are created with the help of an email ids. 
  When no or poor user authentication mechanisms are used, it would be easy for the attackers to create lots of fake accounts. 
  Downside being wastages of resources on the organisation side, and user experience is greatly affected. 
  
  Solutions: 
  1. User authentication by Phone numbers
  2. Using captchas
  3. Using machine learning algorithms to find fake profiles
  
2.	Video Aggregator: There are several Sporting event streaming, TV shows or movies streaming websites, some of them might not work,
only a few might work. Hence, checking each link becomes tedious. 

Solution:
Finding all the relevant urls and providing a single window where the video from any of the sites can be viewed. 
There are plenty of ways in which the web can be crawled to find the relevant links and also there different 
options to finally display the video from these sites. 

3.  Content Aggregation: Like the previous idea, news content can be aggregated from several different news websites
(regarding the same news topics) and displayed in one page, this provides different viewpoints of the same news OR product details 
of a product, can aggregated from several online shopping sites like amazon and ebay and can be displayed in one page for easy price
comparison.

Solution:
Similar to the 2nd idea
